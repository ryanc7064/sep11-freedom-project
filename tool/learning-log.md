Project: Sudoku from 3 by 3 to 9 by 9 but with a clipping mask that limits your vision of the sudoku board

* Today I looked through some of the examples and saw one called "Clipping Mask". Its a circle that follows wherever your mouse cursor goes while also revealing shapes in the background. I tried to tinker with the code on js fiddle by trying to remove the shapes in the background making it just the circle but whatever line I delete, the whole thing breaks and turns yellow or white entirely. I'm not sure why thats happening but I'm still trying to tinker with it.
